## Welcome to My page

I hope you have visited my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSF-smuInDWE6HJGr5JTgwQ?view_as=subscriber). Support me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/NaffyDharni)

I have developed a game using HTML, CSS and JS.
It is open source. The score is also displayed on the screen. Moreover, there is a feature for level selection which decides the speed of the game.

### The code for my project is only in one html file which can be used for free.
